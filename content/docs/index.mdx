Welcome everyone to **utilcn**! This is a **work in progress** project where I'm focusing on creating utility functions and basic functionality for the backend portion of projects.

## What is utilcn?

utilcn is a personal collection of reusable utilities with a focus on backend patterns that I've found useful across different projects.
